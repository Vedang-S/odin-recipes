        <li><strong>Cook Lasagna Noodles: </strong>Boil 9 lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Meat Sauce: </strong>In a large skillet, brown 1 lb ground beef or sausage over medium heat. Add 1 chopped onion and 2 minced garlic cloves, cooking until softened.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Sauce and Seasonings: </strong>Stir in 24 oz of marinara sauce, 1 teaspoon dried basil, and 1 teaspoon dried oregano. Simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>

        <li><strong>Assemble Lasagna: </strong>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles, then half of the ricotta mixture, followed by a third of the remaining meat sauce, and some shredded mozzarella.</li>
